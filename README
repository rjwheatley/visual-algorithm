Learn coding. Teach coding in a Linux environment.

When he was 7 years old, my son became fascinated with sorting algorithms.
He learned the details of algorithms like bubble sort, quick sort, merge
sort, heap sort, etc. which he could demonstrate using a collection of
multi-height lego columns.  I saw an opportunity to teach him to code in C.
This project supplies a means to visualize sorting algorithms as they sort.
It is inspired by many youtube videos.

Perform the following installs:

sudo apt install make
sudo apt install gcc
sudo apt install python-dev
sudo apt install python-pip
pip install pygame
pip install numpy

The algorithms themselves are isolated in their own files.  The goal is for
the new coder to create a collection of files, each file implementing a
different sorting algorithm.  The project contains an example, bogo sort.

The project has 3 components:
  1 - server; provides display; coded in Python; communication via TCP socket
  2 - client; provides user interface; coded in C; 
      communicates with server via TCP socket (request/acknowledgement)
  3 - algorithms; one per file; statically linked with executable; have their
      own section; bogo.c example/template

Copy bogo.c to (e.g.) bubble.c
Code bubble sort.
Call update() whenever a screen update is desired.
Type make to build new executable.
Example invocation:  ./algo -a bogo
